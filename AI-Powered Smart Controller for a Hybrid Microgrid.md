### **A Predictive Energy Management System for a Hybrid Solar-Wind Microgrid** 

This repository contains the project files for an AI-powered smart controller developed as part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship. 

### **1\. About This Project** 

* The continuous growth in renewable energy generation introduces challenges in maintaining grid stability due to the variable nature of solar and wind power. This project aims to develop an AI-powered Smart Controller for a hybrid microgrid that integrates solar, wind, and battery storage systems.   
* The system uses machine learning-based prediction models to forecast solar and wind generation as well as electricity demand. These forecasts enable an intelligent control algorithm to decide how to optimally charge or discharge the battery to maintain a balanced and uninterrupted power supply.   
* By implementing predictive analytics and AI-driven control, this project aims to improve the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of microgrids. 

### **2\. The Problem** 

* Hybrid renewable energy systems suffer from unpredictable fluctuations in power generation caused by weather changes and variable load demand. Without accurate forecasting and intelligent management, this leads to :   
  * Power instability   
  * Unnecessary battery stress and degradation   
  * Energy wastage 

### **3\. Project Objectives** 

* The challenge is to build a predictive energy management system that can :   
  * **Forecast :** Develop accurate forecasting models for solar power, wind power, and electric load demand using machine learning.   
  * **Control :** Design a Smart Controller that manages the power flow between renewable sources, the battery, and the load based on these forecasts.   
  * **Optimize :** Make real-time decisions to balance energy flow and optimize battery usage to ensure a stable supply and reduce costs.   
  * **Simulate & Evaluate :** Test the performance of the controller in a simulation environment to validate its reliability and efficiency. 

### **4\. Tools & Technologies** 

* This project will be developed using the following tools :   
  * **Programming Language :** Python   
  * **Data Processing :** Pandas, NumPy   
  * **Machine Learning :** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras, XGBoost   
  * **Time-Series Forecasting :** ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM   
  * **Visualization :** Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
